# KUSM — Korean University Student Maker

**One-page quick-start guide**

---

## What Is This?

A **browser-based stat-raising visual novel** set in a Korean university.
You create a student, plan their weekly schedule, build relationships with AI-driven NPCs, and shape their story across a 16-week semester (112 days).

Inspired by *Princess Maker 3* (stat management), *RimWorld* (emergent AI agency), and *Blue Archive* (Korean campus drama).

## Core Gameplay Loop

```
Character Creation (name, university, major, storyteller mode)
         ↓
Day N: Schedule Planning
  └─ 7 days × 3 slots → assign 1 of 8 activities per slot
         ↓
Day Runner (9-phase):
  ├─ Base stat deltas from schedule
  ├─ Story Director evaluates tension (Cassandra/Randy/Phoebe)
  ├─ NPC encounters determined (location + director bias)
  ├─ NPC Brains generate dialogue + emotion + stat modifiers
  ├─ Off-camera NPC simulation
  ├─ 3-tier memory updates
  ├─ Crisis detection (collapse, burnout, broke, isolation, GPA probation)
  └─ Game-over check (Day 113 or critical stat failure)
         ↓
Week Summary: stat changes + relationship updates
         ↓
Week 16 → Ending: archetype + grades + semester narrative
```

## Three Storyteller Modes

| Mode | Style |
|------|-------|
| **Cassandra** | Rising tension — foreshadows bad endings |
| **Randy** | Chaos — unpredictable curveballs |
| **Phoebe** | Gentle slice-of-life with occasional drama spikes |

## Tech Stack

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16.2.1 — App Router |
| UI | React 19 + TypeScript 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| State | Zustand 5 + Immer (localStorage-persisted) |
| AI | Google Gemini 3 Flash (`@google/genai`) |
| Validation | Zod 4 + zod-to-json-schema |
| Tests | Vitest — 22 unit tests |

## AI Architecture (3 Layers)

```
Story Director  →  NPC Brains  →  Game Systems
 (what happens?)   (how NPCs react)  (the rules)
```

**7 API routes:** `/api/ai/npc-brain`, `/api/ai/story-director`, `/api/ai/npc-simulation`, `/api/ai/weekly-summary`, `/api/ai/ending`, `/api/art/character`, `/api/art/background`
